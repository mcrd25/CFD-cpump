Computational fluid dynamics simulations
> Initially intended to be simulation for CFD through centrifugal pump - it'd also include various CFD simulations based on thoery and articles I've read. These simulations would be based on crystallizers, reactions and other implementations of CFD. Moore's law has opened the floodgates of CFD simulations. This should be fun.
Terms and topics you will need to understand: Navier-Stokes equations, law of conservation of mass, first law of thermodynamics (law of conservation of energy), fluid flow, laminar flow, turbulent flow, aerodynamics, viscosity, heat trannsfer, denisity, velocity, centrifugal pumps, ...

## Computational Fluid Dynamics Theory
Computational fluid dynamics is the process of mathematically modeling a physical phenomenon involving fluid flow and solving it numerically using computing.

### Simulation 1: Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation through a centrifugal Pump 
Type of fluid flow: turbulent flow.
